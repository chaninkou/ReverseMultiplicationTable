# ReverseMultiplicationTable
-This is a JavaFX GUI-based program that shows a 10 X 10 grid of labels that forms a multiplication table.
-The screen show the labels of multiplication problems, rather than the answers.
-My solution uses a GridPane, several HBoxes, a VBox, and a BorderPane, as well as a Button, a TextField and many Labels.
